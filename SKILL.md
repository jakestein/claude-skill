name: commonpaper
description: Query and manage contracts via the Common Paper REST API. Use when the user asks about their contracts, agreements, signers, NDAs, CSAs, renewals, deal values, or wants to create/void/reassign/send agreements. Also use when user mentions "Common Paper", "commonpaper", asks contract-related questions like "how many signed contracts do I have?" or "do I have an NDA with X?", wants to create or update agreement templates, wants to onboard or set up their Common Paper account, or asks about uploading attachments.

# Common Paper API Skill

## Security Rules

**CRITICAL — follow these rules at all times:**

1. **NEVER display, echo, or include the API token in chat output.** Do not print credentials in responses, code blocks, or explanations unless the user explicitly asks to see them.
2. **NEVER pass the API token as a literal string in command-line arguments.** Always read it from the credentials file via command substitution (see Making Requests below) so the token value is not visible in the command text shown to the user.
3. **When showing the user a curl command** (e.g., if they ask "what query did you use?"), replace the auth header with a placeholder like `-H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN"`. Never substitute in the real value. Always URL-encode brackets as `%5B` and `%5D` in the shown command so it can be copy-pasted into zsh without errors.
4. **Sanitize user inputs** before inserting into URLs. Strip or URL-encode any characters that could break the URL or be used for injection (e.g., `&`, `=`, `#`, `?`, newlines, backticks, `$()`, semicolons). Only allow alphanumeric characters, spaces, dots, commas, hyphens, and common punctuation in filter values.
5. **Validate credential format** before saving. The API token should match the pattern `zpka_*` and contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

## Authentication

The API uses Bearer token authentication. Only an API token is required — the organization is inferred from the token. No Organization ID header is needed.

### Credential Loading

Before making any API call, check if a saved token exists:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists and is non-empty, use its contents as the token. **Do not echo or display the value to the user.**

If the file does not exist or is empty, ask the user:

- **API Token**: "What is your Common Paper API token? (You can generate one from your account's Integrations tab)"

### Credential Validation

Before saving or using the token, validate it:

- Must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores

After receiving and validating the token, test it with a lightweight API call:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements?page%5Bsize%5D=1" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"
```

If the response is not `200`, inform the user that their token appears invalid and ask them to double-check.

### Saving Credentials

After successful validation, ask: "Would you like me to save this token for future sessions?"

If yes:

```bash
echo -n "THE_TOKEN" > ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token && chmod 600 ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token
```

### Making Requests

**All API requests MUST read the token from the credentials file via command substitution to avoid exposing it as a literal in the command.**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements"
```

For POST/PATCH requests, add:
```bash
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Base URL**: `https://api.commonpaper.com/v1`

**IMPORTANT — URL encoding**: Always URL-encode square brackets in query parameters. Use `%5B` for `[` and `%5D` for `]`. Unencoded brackets will cause `zsh: no such file or directory` errors.

**Note**: While `$(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)` is expanded by the shell before execution (so the token briefly appears in the process list), this is significantly better than having the literal token in the command text shown in chat. The token file is also chmod 600 so only the user can read it.

## Endpoints

### List Agreements (Primary endpoint for queries)

```
GET /v1/agreements
```

Returns JSONAPI format with pagination metadata:
```json
{
  "data": [ { "id": "...", "type": "agreement", "attributes": { ... }, "links": { ... } } ],
  "meta": { "pagination": { "current": 1, "next": 2, "last": 5, "records": 127 } },
  "links": { "self": "...", "next": "...", "last": "..." }
}
```

**Key response fields:**
- `meta.pagination.records` — total number of matching agreements (use this for counts instead of paginating through all results)
- `data[].attributes` — agreement fields
- `data[].attributes.display_status` — human-friendly status (e.g., "Completed", "Waiting for counterparty") — prefer this over `status` when presenting to users
- `data[].links.agreement_url` — direct link to the agreement in the Common Paper app

### Get Single Agreement

```
GET /v1/agreements/{id}
```

### Create Agreement

```
POST /v1/agreements
```

**IMPORTANT**: The create endpoint does NOT use JSONAPI format. It uses a flat structure with these top-level keys:

```json
{
  "owner_email": "owner@company.com",
  "template_id": "uuid-of-template",
  "draft": false,
  "agreement": {
    "agreement_type": "NDA",
    "sender_signer_name": "Jane Smith",
    "sender_signer_title": "CEO",
    "sender_signer_email": "jane@company.com",
    "recipient_email": "recipient@example.com",
    "recipient_name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

**Required fields:**
- `owner_email` — email of the user who will own this agreement (must be a user in the org)
- `template_id` — UUID of the template to use (get from `GET /v1/templates`)
- `agreement.recipient_email` — recipient's email address
- `agreement.recipient_name` — recipient's name (REQUIRED — will error without it)

**Top-level options:**
- `draft` — boolean (top-level, NOT nested under `agreement`). When `true`, the agreement is created with status `draft` and is **not** sent to the recipient. Send it later via `POST /v1/agreements/{id}/send`. When `false` or omitted, the agreement is created and sent immediately.

**Optional but recommended fields:**
- `agreement.sender_signer_name`, `agreement.sender_signer_title`, `agreement.sender_signer_email`
- `agreement.recipient_organization`, `agreement.recipient_title`
- `agreement.agreement_type` — NDA, CSA, etc.
- `agreement.test_agreement` — set to `true` to mark as a test; still sends a real email and requires a real recipient, but is noted as not legally binding and does not count against monthly limits
- `cc_users` — array of email addresses to CC on the agreement (must be users in the org)

**Billing fields:**
- `agreement.include_billing_workflow` — set to `true` to enable a billing workflow after signing
- `agreement.billing_workflow_type` — `"link"` or `"stripe"`
- `agreement.payment_link_url` — payment URL shown after signing; requires `include_billing_workflow: true` and `billing_workflow_type: "link"`
- `agreement.include_automated_payment_reminders` — boolean; sends automatic payment reminders when true
- `agreement.include_billing_info` — boolean; enables billing contact fields
- `agreement.billing_name` — billing contact name; used when `include_billing_info` is true
- `agreement.billing_email` — billing contact email; used when `include_billing_info` is true

**Governing law fields:**
- `agreement.governing_law_country` — country whose laws govern the agreement (e.g., `"United States of America"`)
- `agreement.governing_law_region` — state or region whose laws govern the agreement (e.g., `"Delaware"`)
- `agreement.chosen_courts_country` — country where disputes will be resolved
- `agreement.chosen_courts_region` — state or region where disputes will be resolved
- `agreement.district_or_county` — district or county for dispute resolution

**Notice email fields:**
- `agreement.sender_notice_email_address` — email for legal notices to the sender
- `agreement.recipient_notice_email_address` — email for legal notices to the recipient

**Framework terms fields:**
- `agreement.framework_terms_type` — `"new"` (standard) or `"description"` (custom)
- `agreement.framework_terms_description` — custom framework terms; only used when `framework_terms_type` is `"description"`

**Other fields:**
- `agreement.manual_send` — set to `true` to mark the agreement as manually sent outside the platform

### Agreement Actions

```
POST  /v1/agreements/{id}/send          — Send a draft agreement to the recipient
PATCH /v1/agreements/{id}/void          — Void an agreement
PATCH /v1/agreements/{id}/reassign      — Reassign recipient
PATCH /v1/agreements/{id}/resend_email  — Resend signature email
GET   /v1/agreements/{id}/history       — Get agreement history
GET   /v1/agreements/{id}/download_pdf  — Download PDF
GET   /v1/agreements/{id}/shareable_link — Get shareable link
```

**Send**: Only works on agreements in `draft` status (returns 422 otherwise). No request body required.

### Templates

```
GET   /v1/templates          — List all templates
GET   /v1/templates/{id}     — Get single template
POST  /v1/templates          — Create a new template
PATCH /v1/templates/{id}     — Update an existing template
```

Templates have a `type` field in the response indicating the agreement type: `template_nda`, `template_csa`, `template_dpa`, `template_design`, `template_psa`, `template_partnership`, `template_baa`, `template_loi`, `template_software_license`, `template_pilot`.

When creating an agreement, look up the appropriate template by matching the `type` field. For example, to send an NDA, find the template where `type == "template_nda"`.

#### Creating a Template

```
POST /v1/templates
```

The `type` field is required and must be one of the **short names** (not the `template_*` response values):

| `DPA` | Data Processing Agreement |
| `Design` | Design Partner Agreement |
| `Pilot` | Pilot Agreement |
| `PSA` | Professional Services Agreement |
| `Partnership` | Partnership Agreement |

**Example: Create an NDA template**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "NDA",
    "name": "Standard Mutual NDA",
    "governing_law_region": "Delaware",
    "chosen_courts_region": "Delaware",
    "term": 1,
    "confidentiality_period": 2,
    "purpose": "Evaluating a potential business relationship.",
    "negotiations_allowed": true
  }' \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/templates"
```

**Example: Create a CSA template**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "CSA",
    "name": "Standard Cloud Service Agreement",
    "governing_law_region": "Delaware",
    "general_cap_amount_type": "preceding",
    "general_cap_preceding_amount": "1.0",
    "include_security_policy": true,
    "include_dpa": false,
    "template_csa_order_form_attributes": {
      "cloud_service_description": "SaaS platform for team collaboration",
      "subscription_period": 1,
      "subscription_period_unit": "year(s)",
      "fee_period": "year",
      "payment_period": 30,
      "payment_period_unit": "day(s)",
      "invoice_period": "annually"
    }
  }' \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/templates"
```

The response is a JSONAPI object. The new template's UUID is in `data.id`.

#### Updating a Template

```
PATCH /v1/templates/{id}
```

Pass only the fields you want to change. All the same fields from the create endpoint are valid. Nested objects like `template_csa_order_form_attributes` are also accepted.

**Example: Update an NDA template's jurisdiction**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "governing_law_region": "California",
    "chosen_courts_region": "California",
    "district_or_county": "Superior Court of Santa Clara County"
  }' \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/templates/{id}"
```

**Note**: There is no delete endpoint for templates. Templates can be renamed but not removed via the API.

### Attachments

```
POST /v1/attachments       — Upload a file attachment
```

Attachments are files (PDFs, policies, addenda) that can be referenced from templates. Upload uses `multipart/form-data`.

**Request fields (inside the `attachment` form object):**
- `pdf` — the file to upload (required)
- `name` — display name for the attachment (required)
- `description` — optional description
- `uploaded_by` — optional email of the uploader

**Example:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  -F "attachment[name]=Security Policy" \
  -F "attachment[description]=Our information security policy" \
  -F "attachment[uploaded_by]=legal@company.com" \
  -F "attachment[pdf]=@/path/to/security-policy.pdf" \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/attachments"
```

The response includes the attachment ID, which can then be referenced in template fields like `include_security_policy_attachment_id`, `include_dpa_attachment_id`, `include_acceptable_use_policy_attachment_id`, etc.

### Other Endpoints

```
GET /v1/organizations       — List organizations (returns the caller's org)
GET /v1/organizations/{id}  — Get single organization
GET /v1/users               — List organization users
GET /v1/users/{id}          — Get single user
GET /v1/agreement_types     — List all agreement types
GET /v1/agreement_statuses  — List all agreement statuses
GET /v1/agreement_history   — List agreement histories (filterable)
```

### Organizations

The token is scoped to a single organization. `GET /v1/organizations` returns that org as a single-element list. Useful attributes include `name` (the company name), `street_address`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, `country`, and `onboarded`. Use this endpoint to fetch the company name rather than asking the user for it.

### Users

The `/v1/users` endpoint returns user details including `name`, `email`, and `title`. Use this to look up sender information when creating agreements — the user may only provide an email, and you can fill in name/title from the user record.

## Filtering (Ransack)

The API supports filtering via query parameters using ransack predicates. The syntax is `filter[field_predicate]=value`.

### Predicates

| Predicate | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `_eq` | Equals | `filter[status_eq]=signed` |
| `_not_eq` | Not equal | `filter[status_not_eq]=draft` |
| `_cont` | Contains (case-insensitive) | `filter[recipient_organization_cont]=microsoft` |
| `_i_cont` | Contains (case-insensitive, explicit) | `filter[recipient_organization_i_cont]=google` |
| `_gt` | Greater than | `filter[effective_date_gt]=2024-01-01` |
| `_lt` | Less than | `filter[end_date_lt]=2025-12-31` |
| `_gteq` | Greater than or equal | `filter[end_date_gteq]=2025-01-01` |
| `_lteq` | Less than or equal | `filter[end_date_lteq]=2025-12-31` |
| `_present` | Field is not null/empty | `filter[end_date_present]=true` |
| `_blank` | Field is null/empty | `filter[end_date_blank]=true` |
| `_in` | In a list | `filter[status_in][]=signed&filter[status_in][]=sent_to_recipient_for_signature` |
| `_null` | Is null | `filter[end_date_null]=true` |
| `_not_null` | Is not null | `filter[end_date_not_null]=true` |

### Combining Filters

Chain multiple filter params: `filter[status_eq]=signed&filter[agreement_type_eq]=NDA`

### Filterable Fields on Agreements

All agreement columns are filterable, including nested model fields prefixed with the model name. Key fields:

**Identity & Type:**
- `agreement_type` — NDA, CSA, DPA, PSA, Design, Partnership, BAA, LOI, Software License, Amendment, Pilot (or custom)
- `status` — see Agreement Statuses below
- `description`

**Parties:**
- `sender_signer_name`, `sender_signer_email`, `sender_signer_title`
- `sender_organization`
- `recipient_name`, `recipient_email`, `recipient_title`
- `recipient_organization`

**Dates:**
- `effective_date` — when the agreement takes effect
- `end_date` — expiration date
- `sent_date` — when it was sent
- `all_signed_date` — when fully executed
- `sender_signed_date`, `recipient_signed_date`

**Terms:**
- `term` — term length (integer, in units of term_period)
- `term_period_perpetual` — boolean
- `purpose`
- `governing_law_country`, `governing_law_region`

**Financial:**
- `ai_gmv` — gross contract value (available on all agreement types, useful for sorting by deal size)
- `ai_arr` — annual recurring revenue
- `csa_order_form_total_contract_value` — total contract value (CSA-specific)
- `csa_order_form_subscription_fee` — subscription fee amount
- `csa_order_form_payment_period` — payment frequency

**Roles (nested):**
- `agreement_roles_user_email` — filter by user email in any role

**Other nested models:**
- `csa_*`, `csa_order_form_*`, `dpa_*`, `design_partner_*`, `psa_*`, `psa_statement_of_work_*`, `partnership_*`, `partnership_business_terms_*`, `baa_*`, `loi_*`

## Agreement Statuses

The `status` field contains the internal status. The `display_status` field contains a human-readable version. Prefer `display_status` when presenting results to users.

Internal statuses:
- `draft` — Not yet sent
- `sent_waiting_for_initial_review` — Sent, awaiting first review
- `sent_waiting_for_sender_review` — Waiting for sender to review
- `sent_waiting_for_recipient_review` — Waiting for recipient to review
- `in_progress` — Active negotiation
- `sent_to_recipient_for_signature` — Sent for recipient signature
- `sent_to_sender_signer_for_signature` — Sent for sender signature
- `waiting_for_sender_signature` — Awaiting sender signature
- `waiting_for_recipient_signature` — Awaiting recipient signature
- `signed` — Fully executed (display_status: "Completed")
- `signed_waiting_for_final_confirmation` — Signed, pending confirmation
- `declined_by_recipient` — Recipient declined
- `voided_by_sender` — Voided
- `sent_manually` — Sent outside the platform

**Signed/active** = `status_eq=signed`
**In-flight** = any status that is not `draft`, `signed`, `voided_by_sender`, or `declined_by_recipient`

## Pagination

Index endpoints return pagination metadata in `meta.pagination`:
- `records` — total number of matching results (use this for counts!)
- `current` — current page number
- `next` — next page number (null if on last page)
- `last` — last page number

Use `page[number]=N&page[size]=M` query params (URL-encoded: `page%5Bnumber%5D=N&page%5Bsize%5D=M`). Default page size is 25.

**For counting**: Use `page%5Bsize%5D=1` and read `meta.pagination.records` — no need to paginate through all results.

**For complete lists**: Paginate through all pages when the user wants a full list. Check for `meta.pagination.next` and keep fetching until it's null.

## Common Query Patterns

In all examples below, `$AUTH` refers to `-H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)"`.

### "How many signed contracts do I have?"

```bash
curl -s $AUTH \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements?filter%5Bstatus_eq%5D=signed&page%5Bsize%5D=1" | jq '.meta.pagination.records'
```

### "Do I have any contracts with {Company}?"

Use `_cont` for case-insensitive partial matching on `recipient_organization`. Also check `sender_organization` in case the user's org is the recipient.

### "Do I have an active NDA with {Company}?"

Combine agreement type, status, and company filters. An "active" NDA is signed and not expired:

```
filter[agreement_type_eq]=NDA&filter[status_eq]=signed&filter[recipient_organization_cont]={Company}&filter[expired_eq]=false
```

### "Who was the signer on the {Company} account?"

Find agreements with that company and extract signer info from attributes: `sender_signer_name`, `sender_signer_email`, `recipient_name`, `recipient_email`.

### "Largest CSA deal by total contract amount?"

Fetch all signed CSAs and sort client-side by `ai_gmv` with `jq`:

```bash
curl -s $AUTH \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements?filter%5Bagreement_type_eq%5D=CSA&filter%5Bstatus_eq%5D=signed&page%5Bsize%5D=100" \
  | jq '[.data[] | {counterparty: .attributes.recipient_organization, gmv: (.attributes.ai_gmv // "0" | tonumber), summary: .attributes.summary}] | sort_by(-.gmv)'
```

Note: `ai_gmv` may be `"0"` or null for some agreements even if fees exist — check the `summary` field and nested fee data (`csa_order_form.fees`) for the full picture.

### "Upcoming renewal dates?"

```bash
curl -s $AUTH \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements?filter%5Bstatus_eq%5D=signed&filter%5Bend_date_gteq%5D=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)&sort=end_date&page%5Bsize%5D=100"
```

Present results as a table with columns: Agreement Type, Counterparty, End Date, Term.

## Response Handling

### Presenting Results

- Format results as readable tables or summaries
- Use `display_status` (not `status`) when showing status to users
- For agreement lists, include: Agreement Type, Counterparty (recipient_organization), Status (display_status), Effective Date, End Date
- For signer queries, include: Name, Email, Title, Organization
- For financial queries, include currency amounts formatted properly
- When counting, give exact numbers from `meta.pagination.records`
- For date-based reports, sort chronologically and group logically
- Include `links.agreement_url` when the user might want to view the agreement in the app

### Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request**: Check the request body schema — the create endpoint uses a specific format (see Create Agreement above), not JSONAPI.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Token is invalid or expired. Ask the user to check their API token.
- **403 Forbidden** / "You've reached your plan limit": On a new account this almost always means the user's **email is not verified** rather than an actual plan limit. Check `email_verified` on `GET /v1/users` and tell the user to verify their email before trying again. Test agreements bypass plan limits but still require a verified email.
- **404 Not Found**: The agreement or resource doesn't exist.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Invalid filter or request body. Check the filter syntax.

## Write Operations

### Create Template

To create a template:

1. **Confirm the type** — ask the user which agreement type they want (NDA, CSA, DPA, etc.)
2. **Collect parameters** — ask for name and any key settings (jurisdiction, term, etc.) or apply sensible defaults
3. **For CSA only** — `cloud_service_description` is required; ask the user for it if not provided
4. **Confirm details** with the user before creating
5. **POST to `/v1/templates`**

The response includes the new template ID in `data.id`. Show the template name and ID to the user.

### Update Template

To update an existing template:

1. **Identify the template** — list templates if the user didn't specify which one, then confirm
2. **Confirm the changes** before patching
3. **PATCH to `/v1/templates/{id}`** with only the fields being changed

### Create Agreement

To create and send an agreement:

1. **Look up the sender** using `GET /v1/users` to get their name, title, and email
2. **Look up the template** using `GET /v1/templates` and find the one matching the desired type (e.g., `type == "template_nda"`)
3. **Confirm details** with the user before sending
4. **POST to `/v1/agreements`**:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner_email": "owner@company.com",
    "template_id": "uuid-of-template",
    "agreement": {
      "agreement_type": "NDA",
      "sender_signer_name": "Jane Smith",
      "sender_signer_title": "CEO",
      "sender_signer_email": "jane@company.com",
      "recipient_email": "recipient@example.com",
      "recipient_name": "John Doe"
    }
  }' \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements"
```

By default the agreement is **sent immediately** to the recipient. Always confirm with the user before creating, and be explicit that the agreement will be sent right away. If the user wants to review the generated agreement before it goes out, pass `draft: true` (top-level) — the agreement is created in `draft` status and won't be sent until you `POST /v1/agreements/{id}/send`.

The response includes the agreement URL in `data.links.agreement_url`.

### Send Draft Agreement

```
POST /v1/agreements/{id}/send
```

Sends a previously created draft. The agreement must be in `draft` status — sending an already-sent agreement returns 422. No request body needed.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.claude/skills/commonpaper/cp-api-token)" \
  "https://api.commonpaper.com/v1/agreements/{id}/send"
```

### Void Agreement

Always confirm with the user before voiding.

### Reassign Recipient

Requires `recipient_email` and `recipient_name` in the request body.

### Resend Email

Simple PATCH to `/v1/agreements/{id}/resend_email`.

## Workflow

1. **Load or request credentials** (check saved token file first)
2. **Validate token** with a test API call if this is the first use
3. **Understand the user's question** — map it to the right endpoint and filters
4. **Sanitize any user-provided filter values** — URL-encode and strip dangerous characters
5. **Make API call(s)** — read token from file via `$(cat ...)`, use filtering to narrow results server-side when possible
6. **Paginate if needed** — for counts, just read `meta.pagination.records`; for full lists, paginate through all pages
7. **Present results clearly** — tables, summaries, or direct answers. **Never include credentials in output.**
8. **For write operations** — look up user/template info first, confirm details with user, then execute

## Onboarding Mode

Onboarding mode guides a brand-new user through setting up their entire Common Paper account from scratch. Trigger it when the user asks to "set up my account", "onboard", or "create all my templates".

**IMPORTANT — Legal disclaimer**: Always display this at the start of onboarding:

> ⚠️ **Not legal advice.** The suggestions here are common starting points based on your answers, not legal recommendations. Have a qualified attorney review your final templates before use.

### Phase 1: Account setup

Confirm the API token is saved (standard credential flow). Then fetch the company name from `GET /v1/organizations` (`data[0].attributes.name`) — do not ask the user for it. Use this name to prefix template names in Phase 4. Then explain what onboarding will do: ask a few quick questions about their business, then create a sensible set of contract templates tailored to their answers.

### Phase 2: Q&A — show all questions, answer one at a time

Display all questions upfront so the user can see the full scope, then ask them to answer one at a time starting with the first. This lets them see how much work is involved without requiring a single long response.

Keep it conversational and brief — the user should be able to answer in under 5 minutes. Do **not** ask about legal specifics; derive those from their answers.

```
Here's what I'll need to know to set up your templates. I'll ask you one at a time — let's start with the first:

1. What does your product or service do? (1–2 sentences)
2. What state's law do you want governing your agreements? (This is a legal preference, not necessarily where you operate)
3. What's the email of the person who will typically send and sign agreements? (Must be an existing user in your Common Paper account — probably the email you signed up with)
4. Do you sell software as a service (SaaS), on-premise/embedded software, or both?
5. Do you offer professional services? (implementation, consulting, custom dev)
6. Do you have a free trial or pilot program?
7. Do any of your customers work in healthcare, or does your product process health records?
8. Do you have customers in Europe, or does your product process personal data from EU residents?
9. Does your product use AI or machine learning in a way that's visible to your customers?
10. Do you have security certifications? (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, HITRUST — or none yet)

I have your company name from your Common Paper account already — let's start with the first question: what does your product or service do?
```

After each answer, acknowledge it briefly and ask the next question. Once all answers are collected, move to Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Interpret answers and propose a plan

Based on the user's answers, decide which templates to create and what key settings to apply. Use this mapping as your guide — apply judgment, don't apply it mechanically:

**Always create:** NDA (nearly every company needs one)

**Create CSA if:** they sell SaaS or any subscription software

**Create Software License if:** they sell on-premise or embedded software

**Create DPA if:** they have EU customers or process personal data on behalf of customers

**Create BAA if:** they mention healthcare customers or processing health records

**Create PSA if:** they offer professional services, implementation, or consulting

**Create Design Partner if:** they have a pilot or early-access program with design partners

**Create Pilot if:** they have a free trial or paid pilot offering

**Create Partnership if:** they work with resellers, referral partners, or co-sell partners

**Create LOI if:** they mention large enterprise deals, M&A, or complex pre-contract negotiations (otherwise skip)

**Key settings to extrapolate:**

- **Governing law / courts**: Use the state they named.
- **Liability cap (CSA)**: Default to 1× fees paid in the preceding 12 months — standard for most SaaS.
- **DPA on CSA**: Do NOT set `include_dpa: true` on the CSA template — the reference requires a URL or attachment to be meaningful, and leaving it blank creates a broken addendum. Instead, create a standalone DPA template. Note in the plan that customers needing a DPA will sign that as a separate agreement.
- **AI addendum on CSA**: Requires a PDF attachment uploaded first via `POST /v1/attachments`. If the user has an AI addendum PDF during onboarding, upload it and set `include_ai_addendum: true` with `include_ai_addendum_attachment_id` pointing to the returned attachment ID. If not, skip it and include it in the wrap-up to-do list.
- **Security policy on CSA**: Enable `include_security_policy: true` if they have any certifications. Set the relevant cert flags based on what they listed: `include_security_policy_soc2`, `include_security_policy_soc2_type2`, `include_security_policy_iso27001`, `include_security_policy_hitrust`, `include_security_policy_penetration_testing`, etc. Note: HITRUST is a certification framework; HIPAA is a regulatory requirement — treat them separately.
- **Payment terms**: Default to net-30 (30 days), annual invoicing. Adjust to monthly if they mentioned monthly billing.
- **Free trial**: Enable on CSA order form if they said yes.
- **Default signer email**: Use the email from question 3 (signer) on all templates.
- **Negotiations**: Default to `true` (allowed) for all types except DPA and BAA, which default to `false`.

**Before creating anything**, present the plan clearly and wait for explicit confirmation. Do not proceed until the user says yes — a Cowork user may be watching without having initiated the request themselves.

```
Based on your answers, here's what I'm going to create in your Common Paper account:

Templates:
- ✓ NDA — mutual, 1-year term, 2-year confidentiality, [State] law
- ✓ CSA — 1× preceding fees liability cap, net-30, annual billing[, + AI addendum][, SOC 2/HITRUST security policy]
- ✓ DPA — [if applicable]
- ✓ PSA — [if applicable]
- (skipping LOI — not needed based on your answers)
...

Key settings applied to all:
- Governing law: [State]
- Default signer: [email]
- Negotiations allowed: [yes/no per type]

Ready to create these — does this look right, or would you like to change anything first?
```

**Do not create any templates until the user explicitly confirms.**

### Phase 4: Create the templates

Before creating, verify the signer email against `GET /v1/users` to confirm it exists in the account. If it doesn't match any user, ask the user to correct it — `default_signer_email` must be a valid account member.

**Required nested fields by type** — these must be included or the API will return an error:
- **CSA**: `template_csa_order_form_attributes.cloud_service_description`
- **Software License**: `template_software_license_order_form_attributes.software_description`
- **PSA**: `template_psa_statement_of_work_attributes.services_description`

**AI addendum**: requires uploading a PDF via `POST /v1/attachments` first, then setting `include_ai_addendum: true` and `include_ai_addendum_attachment_id` on the CSA template. Do not attempt to enable it without a valid attachment ID.

Create templates one at a time and show progress as each is created. Report each template's name and ID as it's created.

**Org ID**: Do not rely on the users endpoint for the org ID — it may return null for new accounts. Instead, read `attributes.organization_id` from any template response.

### Phase 5: Wrap-up

After all templates are created, show a summary table with direct links to each template in the app. Template app URLs follow this pattern based on type:

| Response type | App URL path |
|---|---|
| `template_nda` | `/organizations/{org_id}/nda/{id}` |
| `template_csa` | `/organizations/{org_id}/csa/{id}` |
| `template_dpa` | `/organizations/{org_id}/dpa/{id}` |
| `template_psa` | `/organizations/{org_id}/psa/{id}` |
| `template_baa` | `/organizations/{org_id}/baa/{id}` |
| `template_loi` | `/organizations/{org_id}/loi/{id}` |
| `template_pilot` | `/organizations/{org_id}/pilot/{id}` |
| `template_design` | `/organizations/{org_id}/design/{id}` |
| `template_partnership` | `/organizations/{org_id}/partnership/{id}` |
| `template_software_license` | `/organizations/{org_id}/software_license/{id}` |

Base URL: `https://app.commonpaper.com`

Present the summary like this:

| Template | Link | Status |
|---|---|---|
| NDA | https://app.commonpaper.com/organizations/{org_id}/nda/{id} | ✓ Created |
| CSA | https://app.commonpaper.com/organizations/{org_id}/csa/{id} | ✓ Created |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Template naming**: Prefix with the company name fetched from `GET /v1/organizations` in Phase 1, e.g., "Acme Corp NDA" or "Acme Corp Cloud Service Agreement".

Then display what **cannot be done via the API** and must be completed manually:

**Here's what to do next in the app (app.commonpaper.com):**

1. **Invite team members** — Add colleagues to your organization (Settings → Members).
2. **Upload your logo** — Add company branding for agreements (Settings → Branding). Requires a Startup plan or higher.
3. **Connect Slack** — Get agreement notifications and updates directly in Slack (Settings → Integrations).
4. **Set up Stripe** — If using Stripe billing workflows, connect your account (Settings → Integrations).
5. **Configure webhooks** — Set up real-time event webhooks (Settings → Integrations).
6. **Add your AI addendum** — If you have an AI addendum PDF, you can upload it via the skill and link it to your CSA template.
7. **Preview each template** — Confirm the generated language looks correct before sending live agreements.

**Want to test before going live?** When sending your first real agreement, consider setting `test_agreement: true`. It still sends a real email to the recipient and looks identical to a live agreement, but is marked as not legally binding and doesn't count against your monthly limit. Once you're confident everything looks right, send the live version.

Finally, always end onboarding with:

> **Want a lawyer to review your templates?** Common Paper works with a legal partner who can review and refine your contracts.

Look up the org ID from `attributes.organization_id` on any template response (not users — that field may be null for new accounts), then provide the direct link:

`https://app.commonpaper.com/organizations/{org_id}/legal_support`

## Notes

- **NEVER expose the API token in chat output or as a literal in commands**
- **Always URL-encode square brackets** in query parameters — use `%5B` for `[` and `%5D` for `]`. Unencoded brackets cause zsh errors.
- The `_cont` predicate is the best choice for company name searches since it handles partial and case-insensitive matching
- When a user asks about a company, search both `recipient_organization` and `sender_organization` fields since either party could be the counterparty
- For "active" or "current" agreements, filter on `status_eq=signed` combined with `expired_eq=false` or `end_date_gteq={today}`
- The API returns JSONAPI format for reads — data is in `response.data[].attributes`
- The API uses a **different format for creates** — NOT JSONAPI. Use `owner_email`, `template_id`, and `agreement` as top-level keys.
- Use `jq` for parsing JSON responses in curl commands
- When showing users the curl command you used, replace the auth header with `$CP_TOKEN` placeholder and ensure brackets are URL-encoded
- Use `display_status` instead of `status` when presenting results to users
- The `summary` field on agreements contains a human-readable summary of key terms — useful for quick overviews
